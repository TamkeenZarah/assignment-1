Agile vs DevOps
Agile is a software developement method works on iterations while Devops is a continous, scalable and wide approach of software deployment

Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment

Continuous Integration is to merge the code into central repo automatically with lesser conflicts.
Continuous Delivery is actually the CI stage being approved, small sprints are created  for small features therefore all changes are automatically tested & build.
Continuous Deployment is continuous testing of each update and then automatically deployment into production environment.
